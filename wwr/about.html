            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Rafting, also known as whitewater rafting, has a rich history that dates back thousands of years. However, it wasn't until 
                the mid-19th century that rafting began to gain popularity as a recreational activity. The modern era of rafting as an 
                adventure sport began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the development of specialized inflatable rafts and the 
                growing interest in outdoor adventure activities. Today, rafting has evolved into a popular outdoor activity, attracting 
                people from all walks of life who seek adventure, adrenaline, and a deep connection with nature.
